''' âœ… Every class in Python inherits from the object class.
    This concept is called Classical Inheritance or more precisely Single Root Inheritance. 
    
    ðŸ§  Explanation:
    In Python 3, all classes (whether you specify it or not) automatically inherit from the built-in base 
    class called object.    
    
    Youâ€™ll see methods like:

    '__class__', '__init__', '__str__', '__repr__', '__eq__', ...


    ðŸ‘‰ All these come from the object class â€” the root of all classes.

    ðŸ§¾ So to complete your sentence:

    Every class in Python inherits from the object class.
    This is called Single Root Inheritance (or sometimes Universal Base Class Inheritance). '''
