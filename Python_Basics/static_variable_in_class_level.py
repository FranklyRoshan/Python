''' üö´ What happens if you modify it using an instance?
        If you do this: 
        You‚Äôre not updating the class variable anymore.
        Instead, you‚Äôre creating a new instance variable named count for that object only. 
        
        Now:
        messi has its own copy of count (instance variable)
        ronaldo and Player still see the original class variable    
        
        ‚ö†Ô∏è Why it‚Äôs a bad practice

        It breaks the shared behavior of class variables.
        It causes confusion and inconsistent data across instances.
        Future code reading becomes harder ‚Äî because it looks like you updated the class variable but didn‚Äôt.'''


''' ‚úÖ Correct way to modify a class (static) variable
    Always modify via the class name, not via the object:'''
Player.count = 100
print(Player.count)

print(messi.count)
print(ronaldo.count)
