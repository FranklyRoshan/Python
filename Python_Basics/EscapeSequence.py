# Escape Sequence
''' What are Escape Sequences?
    Escape sequences are special character combinations used inside strings or characters to represent things 
    that canâ€™t be typed directly (like newline, tab, quotes, etc.).
    They always start with a backslash \.   '''

print("Hello\nWorld")      # New line
print("Hello\tWorld")      # Tab spaces
print("It\'s Python")      # Single quote
print("He said \"Hi\"")    # Double quote
print("C:\\Users\\Frank")  # Backslash
print("Hello\bWorld")      # Backspace
print("A in octal:", "\101")
print("A in hex:", "\x41")
