''' ü¶Ü Duck Typing

        Definition:

        ‚ÄúIf it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it‚Äôs a duck.‚Äù

        In Python, duck typing means that the type or class of an object is less important than the methods it defines.
        You don‚Äôt care what the object is, only that it behaves like what you expect.

        In simpler words:

        You can pass any object to a function ‚Äî as long as it has the required methods or attributes, it will work.'''

class Duck:
    def quack(self):
        print("Quack! Quack!")

class Dog:
    def quack(self):
        print("I'm pretending to be a duck ‚Äî Woof!")

def make_it_quack(thing):
    thing.quack()

duck = Duck()
dog = Dog()

make_it_quack(duck)  # Quack! Quack!
make_it_quack(dog)   # I'm pretending to be a duck ‚Äî Woof!

''' Explanation:
    The function make_it_quack() doesn‚Äôt care if the object is a Duck or a Dog.
    It only expects the object to have a method called quack().
    That‚Äôs duck typing ‚Äî ‚Äúif it quacks like a duck‚Ä¶‚Äù    '''

''' ‚öñÔ∏è Difference Between Duck Typing and Polymorphism
        Feature	        Duck Typing	                                                                        Polymorphism
        Meaning	        Focuses on behavior (methods) rather than the type of object.	                    Allows the same method name to behave differently for different classes.
        Key Idea	    ‚ÄúIf it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it‚Äôs a duck.‚Äù	                    ‚ÄúOne interface, many implementations.‚Äù
        Type Checking	Type of object is not checked; only the presence of method matters.	                Usually involves objects from different classes implementing the same method name.
        Example         Use	You can pass any object to a function as long as it has the required methods.	You can call the same method (speak(), move(), etc.) on different class objects.
        Depends On	    Dynamic typing ‚Äî method existence at runtime.	                                    Inheritance or method overriding, though not always required.
        Error Handling	Raises an error only if the expected method/attribute is missing at runtime.	    The compiler/interpreter expects consistent method names across related classes.    '''
