''' ‚öôÔ∏è 3. Key Differences
        Feature	                Abstract Class	                                Interface
        Purpose	                For code reusability and base behavior	        For defining a contract that classes must follow
        Methods	                Can have both abstract and concrete methods	    Has only abstract methods (in Java; in Python, abstract-only class simulates this)
        Variables	            Can have instance variables	                    Only constants (in Java)
        Access Modifiers	    Can have public, protected, private methods	    All methods are public (in Java)
        Multiple inheritance	A class can extend only one abstract class	    A class can implement multiple interfaces
        Object creation	        Cannot be instantiated	                        Cannot be instantiated
        Python equivalent	    ABC class with abstract + normal methods	    ABC class with only abstract methods
        
        üí¨ In Simple Words:
        üß© Abstract class ‚Üí ‚ÄúBase class with partial implementation.‚Äù
        üß© Interface ‚Üí ‚ÄúBlueprint ‚Äî only method declarations, no implementation.‚Äù'''

''' üß† 1. Abstract Class

        An abstract class is a class that can have both abstract and concrete methods.

        Abstract method ‚Üí declared but not defined (no body)

        Concrete method ‚Üí has a full implementation

        You cannot create an object of an abstract class.
        It is meant to be inherited by child classes.   '''

''' üß© 2. Interface

        Python doesn‚Äôt have a keyword interface like Java,
        but we can simulate interfaces using abstract classes that contain only abstract methods.

        In Java, however:

        An interface is a contract ‚Äî it contains only abstract methods (and constants).

        A class implements an interface to provide functionality for those methods. '''
